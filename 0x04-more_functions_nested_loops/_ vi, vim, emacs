       The _t_i_m_e utility shall invoke the utility named  by  the  _u_t_i_l_i_t_y  operand
       with  arguments  supplied  as the _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t operands and write a message to
       standard error that lists timing statistics for the utility.  The  message
       shall include the following information:

        *  The elapsed (real) time between invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y and its termina‐
           tion.

        *  The User CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the _t_m_s___u_t_i_m_e and  _t_m_s___c_u_‐
           _t_i_m_e fields returned by the _t_i_m_e_s() function defined in the System In‐
           terfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008 for the process in  which  _u_t_i_l_i_t_y  is
           executed.

        *  The  System  CPU  time,  equivalent  to  the  sum of the _t_m_s___s_t_i_m_e and
           _t_m_s___c_s_t_i_m_e fields returned by the _t_i_m_e_s() function for the process  in
           which _u_t_i_l_i_t_y is executed.

       The  precision of the timing shall be no less than the granularity defined
       for the size of the clock tick unit on the system, but the  results  shall
       be  reported  in  terms of standard time units (for example, 0.02 seconds,
       00:00:00.02, 1m33.75s, 365.21 seconds), not numbers of clock ticks.

       When _t_i_m_e is used as part of a pipeline, the times reported  are  unspeci‐
       fied,  except  when  it is the sole command within a grouping command (see

       The  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, _e_n_v, _n_i_c_e, _n_o_h_u_p, _t_i_m_e, and _x_a_r_g_s utilities have been speci‐
       fied to use exit code 127 if an error occurs so that applications can dis‐
       tinguish  ``failure to find a utility'' from ``invoked utility exited with
       an error indication''. The value 127 was chosen because it is not commonly
       used  for other meanings; most utilities use small values for ``normal er‐
       ror conditions'' and the values above 128 can be confused with termination
       due  to  receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner
       to indicate that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
       produce  meaningful  error messages differentiating the 126 and 127 cases.
       The distinction between exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell prac‐
       tice  that  uses  127  when  all  attempts  to  _e_x_e_c the utility fail with
       [[EENNOOEENNTT]], and uses 126 when any attempt to _e_x_e_c the utility fails for  any
       other reason.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       It  is  frequently  desirable  to apply _t_i_m_e to pipelines or lists of com‐
       mands. This can be done by placing pipelines and command lists in a single
       file;  this file can then be invoked as a utility, and the _t_i_m_e applies to
       everything in the file.

       Alternatively, the following command can be used to apply _t_i_m_e to  a  com‐
       plex command:

           ttiimmee sshh −−cc ''_c_o_m_p_l_e_x_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_l_i_n_e''

RRAATTIIOONNAALLEE
       When  the  _t_i_m_e  utility  was  originally  proposed  to be included in the
       ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard, questions were raised about its suitability for
       inclusion  on  the  grounds that it was not useful for conforming applica‐
       tions, specifically:

        *  The underlying CPU definitions from the System  Interfaces  volume  of
           POSIX.1‐2008  are  vague,  so the numeric output could not be compared
           accurately between systems or even between invocations.

        *  The creation of portable benchmark programs was outside the scope this
           volume of POSIX.1‐2008.

       However,  _t_i_m_e  does fit in the scope of user portability. Human judgement
       can be applied to the analysis of the output, and it could be very  useful
       in  hands-on debugging of applications or in providing subjective measures
       of system performance. Hence it  has  been  included  in  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2008.

       The default output format has been left unspecified because historical im‐
       plementations differ greatly in their style of depicting this numeric out‐
       put.  The −−pp option was invented to provide scripts with a common means of
       obtaining this information.

       In the KornShell, _t_i_m_e is a shell reserved word that can be used  to  time
       an  entire  pipeline, rather than just a simple command. The POSIX defini‐
       tion has been worded to allow this implementation. Consideration was given
       to  invalidating  this approach because of the historical model from the C
       shell and System V shell. However, since the System V _t_i_m_e utility histor‐
       ically  has  not produced accurate results in pipeline timing (because the
       constituent processes are not all owned by the same parent process, as al‐
       lowed  by POSIX), it did not seem worthwhile to break historical KornShell
       usage.

       The term _u_t_i_l_i_t_y is used, rather than _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, to highlight the fact  that
       shell  compound  commands, pipelines, special built-ins, and so on, cannot
       be used directly.  However, _u_t_i_l_i_t_y includes user application programs and
       shell scripts, not just the standard utilities.
